## Introduction
Hello and Welcome! I'm a graduate student at the University of Southern Mississippi studying the impacts of deep-sea historic shipwrecks on sediment microbiomes. Reflecting back on my first year, I realized that there are many skills that I still want/need to obtain but that there are also many skills that I have gained. While I'm in no way an expert in the field, I hope that sharing the information I have learned so far will help others who are also new to the field. After all, sharing the information we have learned is the nature of science! 

## Topics
Some of the topics that I will cover include:
* Introduction to Computer Languages
* Frequentist Statistics
* Making Maps
* Marker Genes
* Metagenomics
* Using Markdown
* Using R
* Using Terminal

## Disclaimer
If there's anything this past year has taught me, it's that there is rarely a "one right way" to do something. As such, keep in mind that there are alternatives to the analyses presented here that may be more suitable for your particular needs.
