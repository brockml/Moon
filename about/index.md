## Introduction
---
Hello and Welcome! I'm a graduate student at the University of Southern Mississippi studying the impacts of deep-sea historic shipwrecks on sediment microbiomes. To answer these questions, I use bioinformatics and statistical approaches. Reflecting back on my experience so far, I realized that while there are many skills that I still want/need to obtain there are also many skills that I have gained. Although I'm in no way an expert in the field (*yet*), I hope that sharing the information I have learned in an easily understood way will help others who are also new to the field. After all, sharing the information we have learned is the nature of science! 

## Topics
---
Some of the topics that will be covered include:
* Introduction to Computer Languages
* Frequentist Statistics
* Making Maps
* Marker Genes
* Metagenomics
* Using Markdown
* Using R
* Using Terminal

## Disclaimer

If there's anything graduate school has taught me, it's that there is rarely a "one right way" to do something. As such, keep in mind that there are alternatives to the analyses presented here that may be more suitable for your particular needs.
